# Port Scanner in Golang

Create a port scanner using ~~Python~~ Golang.

### Assignment

In the `port_scanner.py` file, create a function called `get_open_ports` that takes a `target` argument and a `port_range` argument. `target` can be a URL or IP address. `port_range` is a list of two numbers indicating the first and last numbers of the range of ports to check.

Here are examples of how the function may be called:

```
get_open_ports("209.216.230.240", [440, 445])
get_open_ports("www.stackoverflow.com", [79, 82])
```

The function should return a list of open ports in the given range.

The `get_open_ports` function should also take an optional third argument of `True` to indicate "Verbose" mode. If this is set to true, the function shourd return a descriptive string instead of a list of ports.

Here is the format of the string that should be returned in verbose mode (text inside `{}` indicates the information that should appear):

```
Open ports for {URL} ({IP address})
PORT     SERVICE
{port}   {service name}
{port}   {service name}
```

You can use the dictionary in `common_ports.py` to get the correct service name for each port.

For example, if the function is called like this:

```
port_scanner.get_open_ports("scanme.nmap.org", [20, 80], True)
```

It should return the following:

```
Open ports for scanme.nmap.org (45.33.32.156)
PORT     SERVICE
22       ssh
80       http
```

Make sure to include proper spacing and new line characters.

If the URL passed into the `get_open_ports` function is invalid, the function should return the string: "Error: Invalid hostname".

If the IP address passed into the `get_open_ports` function is invalid, the function should return the string: "Error: Invalid IP address".

### Development

Write your code in `port_scanner.py`. For development, you can use `main.py` to test your code. Click the "run" button and `main.py` will run.

### Testing

The unit tests for this project are in `test_module.py`. We imported the tests from `test_module.py` to `main.py` for your convenience. The tests will run automatically whenever you hit the "run" button.

### Submitting

Copy your project's URL and submit it to freeCodeCamp.
